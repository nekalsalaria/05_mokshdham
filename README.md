# Mokshdham Website

## 🌟 Project Overview
Mokshdham is a serene, user-friendly website designed to provide information, guidance, and support regarding final rites and spiritual services. Built with React for the frontend, the site offers a clean, responsive, and modern UI to ensure a smooth user experience.

This project is client work I completed, and the client is very happy with the result. I focused exclusively on crafting a high-quality frontend, while the backend was developed by another team.
